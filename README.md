A fully customization dashboard for SvelteKit.

## Customization

* **Colors**

To custom your own color, you have to change the **colors** property on **tailwind.config.js**. Or read tailwind documentation about this, [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#color-object-syntax](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#color-object-syntax)

* **Component**

Everything component with includes property **classes** is means additional class.
